# LieDetectionLlama2

We used the Replicate's API for Python to test Llama 2 in lie detection tasks by using different prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, etc.) on three different datasets created for this purpose but related to three different types of statements: opinions, memories and intentions.

This was the project for the Cognitive, Behavioral and Social Data course of my master's degree.
