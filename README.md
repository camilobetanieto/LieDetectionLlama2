# LieDetectionLlama2

We used the Replicate's API for Python to test Llama 2 in lie detection tasks by using different prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, etc.) on three different datasets created for this purpose but related to three different types of statements: opinions, memories and intentions.

This was the project for the [Cognitive, Behavioral and Social Data](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2022/LM/SC/SC2377/001PD/SCP7079219/N0) course of my master's degree.
